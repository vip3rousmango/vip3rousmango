## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a self-taught creative technologist who's spent 15+ years building systems that make the digital world feel human again.

I run <strong><a href="https://virtuallycreative.ca">Virtually(Creative)</a></strong>, a boutique, high-trust digital shop that helps small & mid-sized businesses operate like elite teams: faster decisions, tighter automations, compliance handled, and data that actually tells a story.

I started in the LAMP-stack trenches. I broke things. I rebuilt them. Eventually I realized my real superpower wasn’t “coding websites”—it was **connecting the messy human side of business to the machine side of the internet**. These days that looks like AI agents inside WordPress, CRM-driven automations, behavior-first analytics, and making accessibility compliance not suck.

Coding is my canvas. Automation is the brush. Data is the light.
