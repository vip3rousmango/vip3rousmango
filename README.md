### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a self-taught creative technologist who's spent the last 15+ years building systems that make the digital world feel human again.

Founder of [Virtually(Creative)](https://virtuallycreative.ca), I specialize in merging **automation, accessibility, AI**, and **analytics** to help small businesses punch above their weight.

From scripting my first LAMP-stack site to launching AI-enhanced workflows, coding has always been my canvas.
