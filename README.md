## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
```bash

```
I'm Al. I'm a self-taught web developer with a nack for learning new things and breaking stuff. I enjoy being creative but find expressing it artistically, difficult. But, once I found coding, I was able to express that creativity that no paint-brush or paint-mouse ever quite could do for me and I've never looked back since.

:notes: Started with the LAMP-stack, now I'm all about that JAM-stack. :notes:

- **Ollie-UI** - a JavaScript starter-kit for rapidly scaffolding web pages and stuff.
- **Faye** - My first Ghost Theme built upon the default, Casper.
